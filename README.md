This repo includes all open source content for the Nebraska GenCyber camp. Files in this repository are intended to provide step-by-step self paced tutorials to teachers seeking to learn about cybersecurity first principles as part of the UNO Gencyber camp. The strategy is to *learn by doing*. The 2017 camp theme is `IoT Security`.
