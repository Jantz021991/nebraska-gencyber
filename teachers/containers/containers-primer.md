# Containers

### Cybersecurity First Principles
* __Domain Separation__: Good fences make good neighbors. When trying to secure a home or computer, separating the areas where resources are and people work prevents accidents and loss of data or private information. We are preventing the information worlds from colliding. In this lesson, we apply this principle to managing distinct sets of resources by seperating them with a virtual fence in a 'virtual machine.'

* __Resource Encapsulation__: A resource can be hardware such as memory, disk drives, or a display screen. It can also be system objects such as semaphores, a linked list, or shared memory. Processes (or programs) need resources to run. Resources have to be separated and used in the way they were intended. Virtual machines encapsulate an operating system and all of the processes and applications it contains.

* __Process Isolation__: A process is when a program is run. By keeping processes separated, it prevents the failure of one process from causing another to fail. Virtual machines isolate processes running inside them from those running elsewhere on a computer. This allows users to do many dangerous tasks (such as malware analysis) with little or no risk of harm outside of the virtual machine.
