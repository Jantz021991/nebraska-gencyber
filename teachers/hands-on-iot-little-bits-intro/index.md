# Hands-on IoT with - Littlebits Intro

### Cybersecurity First Principles in this lesson

* __Abstraction__: An abstraction is a representation of an object or concept. The gauges in an automobile are an abstraction of the performance of a car. A map is an abstraction of the earth. Abstraction allows us to model an object without considering all of the (possibly infinite) complexity that the object may contain.

* __Modularization__: The concept of modularity is like building blocks. Each block (or module) can be put in or taken out from a bigger project. Each module has its own separate function that is interchangeable with other modules.

* __Simplicity__: Simplicity allows a person to better understand hardware and software. Without the clutter of unnecessarily complicated code and interfaces, the software will be more understandable by people that will update the code when requirements change. It will be easier to understand by the testers and they will be able to spot problems sooner. By keeping software as simple and as focused as possible, the reliability and security is greatly increased.

### Introduction
In this lesson we will explore a cool hands-on technology called [Littlebits](http://littlebits.cc/). Littlebits, follows a _component-based design_ paradigm using _GPIO_ (or general purpose input/output) to let you easily make apps. We will learn how to plug and play bits together to make some simple inventions. Littlebits will be the central platform for the rest of camp and you will be using them in other lessons.
